## Academic Policy Disclaimer

Due to the academic policies associated with our course, we are required to maintain confidentiality regarding the complete details of our projects. This obligation prohibits us from publicly sharing the full scope of our work on platforms like GitHub. To comply with these guidelines while still demonstrating our project's capabilities, we have chosen to display only select parts of our report, focusing primarily on the architecture aspect.

To offer a glimpse into the technical depth of our project, we have included code samples from key modules such as ALU, FIFO, and tb_ALU. These samples serve as a reference to illustrate the methodologies and quality of coding practices employed in our work. They are intended to provide insights into our approach without revealing the entire project content, thus maintaining the integrity of the course's requirements and academic honesty policies.

If you are interested in obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of the project, including its complete code, I encourage you to contact me directly. I am available to share these details in a private manner, ensuring that we adhere to the confidentiality terms set forth by our academic program. This approach allows us to engage in meaningful, collaborative discussions or educational exchanges that are enriched by the full context of the project, while still respecting the course's privacy constraints.
